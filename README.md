# 99 Haskell Problems

This repository contains my solutions to the 99 Haskell Problems. These problems are a well-known set of exercises designed to help practice and improve skills in Haskell and functional programming.

The original list of problems can be found at:
https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

The problems cover a wide range of topics including basic list processing, recursion, combinatorics, and working with trees and graphs.

Each problem is implemented in its own file. Solutions are written to be as clear and idiomatic as possible, focusing on correctness and simplicity rather than optimization or cleverness.

This project is intended as a learning exercise. You are encouraged to try solving each problem on your own before looking at any solutions.

No external libraries are used unless explicitly mentioned.
